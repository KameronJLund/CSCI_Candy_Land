## An Overview  
Candy land is an application that similatues the popular Candyland board game for up to 4 players (with some interesting twists of course). The biggest change from traditional Candyland is the digital character system which stores an inventory, as well as gold and stamina values. These stamina values and inventories allow for more player control over their experience, and introduce a great deal of strategy. The card are also more exciting in this rendition; with a deck of 60 cards being generated and ordered randomly. Cards can be added to the deck, the deck can be reshuffled, and of course cards are taken out of the deck when drawn by a player. Cards also have an attribute known as catastrophic in this version. If you draw a catastrophic card, an event will trigger, which may even allow you to play a mini game to recover. Tiles on the gameboard are each individual objects which store basic info like color, as well as potential candy shops, or special tile attributes. Candy shops and special tiles are distributed randomly, which means that each game is significantly different from the former. Dive deep and enjoy, the menus are designed to be intuitive and reflect player desires at key moments, like giving you an option to make signifcant decisions as vital moments!
